To use the TinyMCE plugin click on the Video Enhanced icon and a pop up window will appear.

You can either add the page url i.e. http://www.zimbi.net When you click "insert", Video enhanced will translate the url in to short tags.

Or

You can insert the short tags manually. You will need to take the characters from the end of your video pages url. For example if you wanted to add this video: http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTI5MDIwNjg0.html

You would take this part of the code "XMTI5MDIwNjg0" and add it to a short tag as follows:

[youku id="XMTI5MDIwNjg0"]`


You can also insert flash by specifying the url and the size of the flash player.
